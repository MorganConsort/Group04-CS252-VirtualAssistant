"""Visual pass over a PDF (issue #9): a vision model notes what text extraction misses.

Diagrams, charts, image tables and scanned pages carry ideas that pypdf cannot read. The
notes are stored beside each page's text and read by concept extraction; they are never
cited, because they are model output, not the slide's own words. Given earlier notes (a
re-upload), the model revises them instead of starting over.
